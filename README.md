# SIADS 697 Manual
The Capstone is the final class in the Master's of Applied Data Science program. It is intended to give students a hands-on, truly applied experience. The course is meant to be a sandbox where students can set ambitious goals and dive deep into the topics that excite them. Engagement with hard problems is more important than any result.

This repository contains materials that may be used for running the Capstone. As there are no "lessons" or modules built into the course, leading the Capstone is more like being a technical project manager than a typical instructor. Please consider this repository an evolving resource and feel free to submit changes and fixes.
